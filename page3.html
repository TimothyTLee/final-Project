          There aren't a lot of parts that can be maintained on a water heater,
          but the few that can be are vital to the health of your waterheater.
          Did you know that water is the number one culprit that damages a water
          heater? Water is aggressive by nature and attacks the waterheaters
          inner metal tank which, and if not properly maintained will weaken the
          metal and cause catastrophic failure.

          Trick 1- Make it a good practice to drain your heater at least once a
          year. This will help eliminate sediment buildup which will help
          provide the optimum gallons of hot water storage. A waterheater can
          fill up sediment quickly thus, reducing the storage capacity. Sediment
          also hinders the heaters ability to heat the water efficiently as the
          heat is forced to travel through thick layers of buildup. If you are
          wondering if you waterheater has sediment in it just listen for a
          popping sound when the heater begins to heat. To drain the hester, use
          a good garden hose. Connect it to the drain valve located on the
          bottom of the heater. Once connected snake the outlet end of the hose
          to a drain or outside, then open the valve and check for unobscured
          water flow.

          Trick 2- turn the temperature down on the control valve(aka, gas
          valve) setting the temperature to 120 degrees will save on fuel cost
          and will help preserve the life of your control valve. It is also a
          safety issue that can prevent scalding. There are usually three
          different setting on a control valve, Hot, Hotter and Very Hot. dial
          it between the Hot and Hotter settings.

        <h1 class="waterheater-tips">Tips</h1>
        <p class="heater-basics">
          Tip 1- Test your T&P valve at least one a year. It is a brass valve
          that is located either on the top of the heater or on the upper side
          it should have some type of piep connected to it. Using a bucket to
          catch the water, flip the little lever open then close it after a few
          seconds. If water continues to run, the valve is bad an must be
          replaced immediately. This is a safety feature that will protect your
          heater from exploding. To change the T&P valve the heater must be
          turned off and drained about quarter to half way. The valve can then
          be unscrewed and replaced. be sure to match up the BTU and pressure on
          the metal tag located on the unit. be sure that piping is connected to
          the outlet of the valve to protect from scalding.

          Tip 2- Change out the Sacrificial Anode rod. This is one secret that
          the homeowner is seldom told about, but this one thing will add many
          years to your heaters life. The Anode Rod protects the inner tank from
          being attacked and weakened. As the name suggests the Sacrificial rod
          will be attacked and corode. Some say that the rod only needs to be
          changed out every three to five years. I would check it every year.
          Chances are that after one year the rod will need to be replaced. and
          $30 anode rod is much cheaper to buy and replace then a $900
          waterheater. To replace the Anode rod, you will first need to locate
          it. Many screw in from the top some from the sides and some brands
          have them build into the water inlet.loof for a pentagon nut that is
          the anode rod. The heater will need to be shut off and drained about a
          quarter of the way. then the rod will unscrew. keep in mind that they
          are usually 2 feet to 4 feet in length. So be sure to have clearance
          room.
