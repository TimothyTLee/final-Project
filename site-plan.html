        Too often we shy away from simple and straight-forward plumbing repairs because of past bad experiences, or terrible advice from the "expert" at the local hardware store.
        We are quick to opt out choosing to pay the extremely high plumber repair price for a job that took less than a half hour to complete.
        Plumb'd Crazy offers a simple approach to repairing and maintaining the most common home plumbing issues.  All of the repair issues presented and discussed on this site.
        are issues that I have personally helped talk people through nearly every-single day for over 20 years. Almost every person who has followed the advice and instructions that have been shared 
        with them has come back and told me it was easier then they thought it would be. That is plumbing repair in a nut shell. 
        I have broken down my website into three sections that will focus on specific repair projects that, when followed properly, will actually save you time, money, and keep you stress-free.
        page two (2) will focus on sink faucet and tub and shower valve repair and maintenance. I will even discuss how to clear simple drain clogs.
        Water heaters prices continue to climb with no end in sight. Did you know that within the past 10 years waterheater prices have jumped up over 100% ? Sad but true. with water heaters nearly
        a thousand dollars ($1000) they are a huge expense, but with periodic maintenance and learning some tricks that heater can last many years beyond its warranty. 
        On page three (3) I will share some simple tips how to help that heater last.

      <h3>Page 2 Sample Paragraph</h3>
      <p> Anyone can repair a faucet. There are Just a couple of must do's to
        make the repair go much easier. Before getting started know what brand
        faucet you have. If you don't know then take lots of pictures to use
        as identifiers when shopping for repair parts. 1-Make sure the water
        to the faucet is turned off. 2-take off the handle, the cartridge to
        be repaired or changed is positioned under it.There are two ways to
        remove the handle. The first is by loosening the alan screw
        positioned, either in the front side or rear side of the handle. if
        you don't have a hole on the side then you have a top mount screw
        style. to remove this type of handle, you will need to pry off the
        index button (hot/cold) on top of the handle and expose the screw.
        Simply remove the screw and wiggle the handle to remove it. 3-There
        are a couple types of retainers used to secure the cartridge, knowing
        what brand faucet you have will be most benefitial for this step. The
        most common retainer will be a brass nut, or cap, which will need to
        be loosened using an adjustable wrench or pliers. Once the nut is
        removed the cartridge pulls out. The other is a pin style. Once the
        handle is removed exposing the top of the cartridge look for a copper
        or stainless steel u-style pin.Once located, simple pull the pin,
        using a pair of pliers. Once removed grip the cartridge with the
        pliers and while using a wiggling motion pull until it come out. Take
        the cartridge with you to purchase a replacement. There are some that
        look similar BUT will not interchange.</p>
        
        <h2>Water Heater Maintenance</h2> 
        
        <h3>Sample images for Page 3</h3>
        <img src="images/heater-sediment.jpg" alt="sediment buildup">
        <img class="image002" src="images/anode-rod.jpg" />
        <h3> Page 3 Sample Paragraph</h3>
          <p>
        There aren't a lot of parts that can be maintained on a water heater,
        but the few that can be are vital to the health of your waterheater.
        Did you know that water is the number one culprit that damages a water
        heater? Water is aggressive by nature and attacks the waterheaters
        inner metal tank which, and if not properly maintained will weaken the
        metal and cause catastrophic failure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trick 1- Make it a good practice to drain your heater at least once a
        year. This will help eliminate sediment buildup which will help
        provide the optimum gallons of hot water storage. A waterheater can
        fill up sediment quickly thus, reducing the storage capacity. Sediment
        also hinders the heaters ability to heat the water efficiently as the
        heat is forced to travel through thick layers of buildup. If you are
        wondering if you waterheater has sediment in it just listen for a
        popping sound when the heater begins to heat. To drain the hester, use
        a good garden hose. Connect it to the drain valve located on the
        bottom of the heater. Once connected snake the outlet end of the hose
        to a drain or outside, then open the valve and check for unobscured
        water flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trick 2- turn the temperature down on the control valve(aka, gas
        valve) setting the temperature to 120 degrees will save on fuel cost
        and will help preserve the life of your control valve. It is also a
        safety issue that can prevent scalding. There are usually three
        different setting on a control valve, Hot, Hotter and Very Hot. dial
        it between the Hot and Hotter settings.
