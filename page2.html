        <p class="faucet-components">
          Anyone can repair a faucet. There are Just a couple of must do's to
          make the repair go much easier. Before getting started know what brand
          faucet you have. If you don't know then take lots of pictures to use
          as identifiers when shopping for repair parts. 1-Make sure the water
          to the faucet is turned off. 2-take off the handle, the cartridge to
          be repaired or changed is positioned under it.There are two ways to
          remove the handle. The first is by loosening the alan screw
          positioned, either in the front side or rear side of the handle. if
          you don't have a hole on the side then you have a top mount screw
          style. to remove this type of handle, you will need to pry off the
          index button (hot/cold) on top of the handle and expose the screw.
          Simply remove the screw and wiggle the handle to remove it. 3-There
          are a couple types of retainers used to secure the cartridge, knowing
          what brand faucet you have will be most benefitial for this step. The
          most common retainer will be a brass nut, or cap, which will need to
          be loosened using an adjustable wrench or pliers. Once the nut is
          removed the cartridge pulls out. The other is a pin style. Once the
          handle is removed exposing the top of the cartridge look for a copper
          or stainless steel u-style pin.Once located, simple pull the pin,
          using a pair of pliers. Once removed grip the cartridge with the
          pliers and while using a wiggling motion pull until it come out. Take
          the cartridge with you to purchase a replacement. There are some that
          look similar BUT will not interchange.

        <h1 class="where-to-buy">Where to shop</h1>
        <p class="stems">
          Now that you have your Faucet cartridge out its time to go shopping.
          If you know where the faucet was purchased then return there to get
          the right replacement parts. In the instance that you do not know
          where it was purchased or cannot find a brand name anywhere then you
          will need to find somewhere for parts. This can be challenging.
          Usually, a quick google will point you in the right direction. If the
          only place to shop is at the big box stores, keep this in mind- not
          all faucets are created equal! Just because a part might look similar
          doesn't mean it will work. If the salesperson tells you that it's
          "really close", be very skeptical and find out what their return
          policy is. The chance that the caartridge will not fit is extremely
          high.

        <h1 class="replacing-cartridge">Replacing Cartridge</h1>
        <p class="working-faucet">
          Once the proper cartridge has been purchased and ready to install it's
          always a good idea to grease all the gaskets and o-rings with a food
          grade silicone grease before re-installing. This will ensure that they
          will stay pliable and not dry out which in turns keeps your faucets in
          optimum working condition. Then simply reverse the steps used to
          remove the cartridge. A good tip to remember is that a faucet needs to
          be exercised. If you have a faucet that gets seldom use turn it on
          weekly for just a few seconds. This helps keep everything working
          smoothly, as well as protecting your faucet from freeze-ups. Adding a
          faucet maintenance "to do list" to your yearly or bi-yearly calendar
          is a good safeguard against stress and frustration that seems to be
          associated with plumbing problems. As the old saying goes "an ounce of
          prevention is worth a pound of cure."
