          Lets get started by debunking a myth that faucets are too hard and
          complicated to attempt repairs. Nothing is further from the truth. All
          faucets work the same way. You have a cold inlet (right) and a hot
          inlet (left). Each side has a valve of a specific design that when
          turned off will not allow water to flow through the faucet mixer
          portion. these valves are know by a couple of names. Either stems or
          cartridges. When a handle is turned on the coorsponding water for that
          side will flow (hot or cold). Now, there are some faucets which are
          considered "throw away faucets" These are usually cheaply made with
          plastic materials and cost very little. My advice when purchasing this
          type of faucet is to be prepared for a faucet that will last anywhere
          from 1 month to 9 months before it fails. When purchasing faucets -
          ask questions! a few of the most important ones to ask are: - what is
          the warranty for both finish and working parts? - Are parts readily
          avaliable? If the answer is yes make sure you look at them and price
          them many times the parts are very expensive. - Is there a website to
          the company with working contact information? Then check it out. If
          the answer is either No or I Don't Know, or Not sure then look for
          something else.

          Faucets with repair parts available will have either stems or
          cartridges. So lets learn what the differences are. Stems are a
          compression style stopper. They are usually a multi-turn type meaning
          rhe handle will turn a number of rotations to open or close. This type
          hasa rubber material washer on the end of the stems that seals on a
          raised section in the valve called a seat. In nearly all cases both
          washer and seat can be easily replaced to help the faucet perform as
          it should without leaks. Furthermore, the stems are replaceable as
          well if and when it finally wears out. This is a common mainenance
          issue with this type of working component. the cost to repair these
          can be as low as $1.00 to a high of $40.00 on average. Next we have a
          cartridge. These are usually a quarter turn style stopper. The main
          material is a smooth ceramic material. These are not repairable, and
          will need to be repalces when its time. Expect the price of these
          types to range from approx $15.00 to $80.00 on average. Cartridges
          life expectancy is about twice what a stems set and washer will
          last(not the stem itself). But are more negatively affected by hard
          water.
