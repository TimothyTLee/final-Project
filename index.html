      <h3>Plumbing Repairs Are Simple Repairs</h3>
      <p>
        Too often we shy away from simple and straight-forward plumbing repairs because of past bad experiences, or terrible advice from the "expert" at the local hardware store.
        We are quick to opt out choosing to pay the extremely high plumber repair price for a job that took less than a half hour to complete.
        Plumb'd Crazy offers a simple approach to repairing and maintaining the most common home plumbing issues.  All of the repair issues presented and discussed on this site.
        are issues that I have personally helped talk people through nearly every-single day for over 20 years. Almost every person who has followed the advice and instructions that have been shared 
        with them has come back and told me it was easier then they thought it would be. That is plumbing repair in a nut shell. 
        I have broken down my website into three sections that will focus on specific repair projects that, when followed properly, will actually save you time, money, and keep you stress-free.
        page two (2) will focus on sink faucet and tub and shower valve repair and maintenance. I will even discuss how to clear simple drain clogs.
        Water heaters prices continue to climb with no end in sight. Did you know that within the past 10 years waterheater prices have jumped up over 100% ? Sad but true. with water heaters nearly
        a thousand dollars ($1000) they are a huge expense, but with periodic maintenance and learning some tricks that heater can last many years beyond its warranty. 
        On page three (3) I will share some simple tips how to help that heater last.
